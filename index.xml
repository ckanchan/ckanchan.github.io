      <description>This is a customary &amp;lsquo;Hello world!&amp;rsquo; post to check out whether everything&amp;rsquo;s working on this site, which is not only my personal page but also a work-in-progress learning project for web dev. This initial release is made with the Hugo static site generator, as a straightforward static site serves my needs (articles and a portfolio) well. I&amp;rsquo;m developing the theme in concert with the site as part of webdev learning, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple patchwork at the moment.</description>
