    <p>Were an ancient Mesopotamian to find themselves flung into the far future of 2018 through some grotesque mishap, they might very well appreciate the ubiquity of our smartphones and tablets. When they&rsquo;re not bursting with distraction and spectacle, these small, oblong artefacts displaying all manner of text perhaps evoke the memories of their clay ancestors, both of which became indispensable tools within their societies.</p>

<p>Working with ancient cuneiform texts on an electronic device is not quite as straightforward as on clay hardware: with the latter, you can just grab a lump of clay and a reed and start writing. The other is a labyrinth of fonts, codepoints and higher planes of (Unicode) existence. In this series, I recount my journey from a wet-behind-the-ears Assyriology student trying to find the <del>laziest</del> easiest way to type in the <em>lišānum Akkadûm</em>, to writing cuneiform-literate computer and iOS programs to assist me in my doctoral research.
In the first article, I explore how computers understand written text, and how they translate everything from the Latin alphabet to cuneiform into their native binary language. Subsequent posts will cover my initial ham-fisted forays of working with computer cuneiform in word processors and spreadsheets, the world&rsquo;s largest open access cuneiform website, and learning how to code computer-compatible cuneiform software: a text reader and finally a text editing package.</p>
